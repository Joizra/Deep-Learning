# Multilayer-Perceptron
Predict diabetes using Multilayer Perceptron
The paper describes and provides a detailed account of the implementation and testing of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using Keras to determine whether a patient has diabetes. 
MLP is an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture developed as a solution to the limitations of the perceptron, which represents the simplest ANN architecture [1, p.305]. An MLP typically comprises an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer [1, p.309]. When an MLP incorporates a deep stack of hidden layers, it is referred to as a deep neural network (DNN) [1, p.309]. 
The task at hand involves employing MLP with Keras for the purpose of diagnosing diabetes in patients. This task essentially translates to binary classification, where two labels are used: '1' signifies that a patient has diabetes, while '0' indicates that a patient does not have diabetes. 
Once the MLP model has been implemented, its performance will be evaluated based on the accuracy of its diagnostic predictions.
